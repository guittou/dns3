## 🚀 Quick Start for Testing

### 1. Run Database Migrations

```bash
# BACKUP FIRST!
mysqldump -u dns3_user -p dns3_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d).sql

# Run migrations
mysql -u dns3_user -p dns3_db < migrations/008_enforce_single_parent.sql
mysql -u dns3_user -p dns3_db < migrations/009_add_history_actions.sql
```

### 2. Test the UI

1. Navigate to `/zone-files.php`
2. Verify Parent column appears in table
3. Click any zone row to open modal
4. Test all three tabs
5. Create a new include from a parent zone
6. Reassign an include to different parent
7. Delete a zone (soft delete)

### 3. Verify Database Changes

```sql
-- Check single-parent constraint
DESCRIBE zone_file_includes;
-- Should show UNIQUE key on include_id

-- Check history actions
SHOW COLUMNS FROM zone_file_history WHERE Field = 'action';
-- Should include 'assign_include' and 'reassign_include'

-- View reassignment history
SELECT * FROM zone_file_history 
WHERE action = 'reassign_include' 
ORDER BY changed_at DESC;
```
