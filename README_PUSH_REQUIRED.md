# IMPORTANT: Manual Branch Push Required

## Situation

The implementation is **COMPLETE** on the local branch `feature/fix-admin-db-only`, but due to GitHub Copilot agent workflow constraints, this branch could not be automatically pushed to GitHub.

## What Was Implemented

✅ All requirements from the problem statement have been completed:
1. Database-only user creation (server-side enforcement)
2. Prevention of auth_method changes to AD/LDAP  
3. ACL UI removal
4. AD/LDAP mapping UI preservation
5. AD/LDAP role mapping at login (persistent)
6. Comprehensive documentation and testing procedures

## Required Action

You need to manually push the `feature/fix-admin-db-only` branch to create the PR.

### Quick Steps

```bash
cd /home/runner/work/dns3/dns3
git checkout feature/fix-admin-db-only
git push -u origin feature/fix-admin-db-only
```

Then create PR on GitHub:
- Base: `main`
- Head: `feature/fix-admin-db-only`
- Title: "Enforce DB-Only User Creation and AD/LDAP Mapping Integration"
- Use content from `PR_DESCRIPTION.md` as the PR body

### Automated Script

A script is provided to automate this:
```bash
