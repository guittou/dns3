# Modal Sizing Fix - Implementation Documentation

## Problem Statement

The zone editing modal's "Éditeur" tab was truncated in the UI. The popup didn't properly adapt its height to the tab content, and the editor (textarea) was cut off, making it difficult to edit zone files.

## Solution

Modified `assets/js/zone-files.js` to implement proper modal sizing that adapts to the tallest tab.

### Key Changes

1. **`adjustZoneModalTabHeights()` - Complete Rewrite**
   - Now measures the actual required height of each tab pane
   - Temporarily makes inactive tabs visible (position: absolute, visibility: hidden) to measure their scrollHeight
   - Calculates the maximum height needed across all tabs
   - Computes total modal height: header + tabs + footer + max pane content
   - Caps the result at viewport available height
   - Applies both `height` and `maxHeight` to modalContent for proper sizing
   - Sets up flex column layout for tab panes
   - Configures textarea/editor elements to fill available space and scroll internally

2. **`lockZoneModalHeight()` - Made Non-Destructive**
   - Converted to a no-op function
   - Kept for backward compatibility to avoid breaking existing call sites
   - No longer overwrites the calculated height from `adjustZoneModalTabHeights()`

3. **`handleZoneModalResize()` - Simplified**
   - Now simply calls `adjustZoneModalTabHeights()` on resize
   - Removed unnecessary unlock/lock cycle since `lockZoneModalHeight()` is now a no-op

### Implementation Details

The new approach:
1. Finds all tab panes (`.tab-pane` and elements with ID ending in 'Tab')
2. Iterates through each pane and measures its scrollHeight
3. For inactive panes, temporarily makes them visible for measurement using:
   - `position: absolute` (removes from layout)
   - `visibility: hidden` (invisible but rendered)
   - `display: block` (ensures it's rendered)
   - `classList.add('active')` (applies active styles)
4. Restores original state after measurement
5. Calculates final modal height as: min(desiredHeight, viewportAvailable)
6. Sets both `height` and `maxHeight` on modalContent
7. Configures tab content areas with exact height and flex layout
8. Ensures textareas/editors fill space (flex: 1 1 auto) and scroll internally

### Expected Behavior

1. **Modal Opening**: Modal sizes to accommodate the tallest tab content
2. **Tab Switching**: Modal remains stable in size when switching between tabs
3. **Editor Tab**: Editor textarea fills available space and scrolls internally
4. **Window Resize**: Modal recalculates and adapts to new viewport size
5. **Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes (desktop/mobile)

### Testing Guidelines

1. **Hard Refresh**: Use Ctrl+F5 to ensure latest JS is loaded
2. **Tab Navigation**: Switch between all tabs (Détails, Éditeur, Includes)
   - Modal should maintain stable height
   - No jumping or resizing
3. **Editor Tab**: 
   - Editor should occupy full available space
   - Long content should scroll within the editor, not the modal
4. **Window Resize**: 
   - Resize browser window
   - Change device orientation (mobile)
   - Modal should adapt smoothly
5. **Console Check**: No JavaScript errors
6. **Functionality Check**: All buttons (Save, Cancel, Delete, Generate) work normally

### Files Modified

- `assets/js/zone-files.js` - Modified 3 functions:
  - `adjustZoneModalTabHeights()` - Complete rewrite with tab measurement logic
  - `lockZoneModalHeight()` - Converted to no-op
  - `handleZoneModalResize()` - Simplified to just call adjust function

### No Breaking Changes

- All existing function signatures preserved
- Backward compatible with existing code
- No changes to HTML structure or IDs
- No destructive CSS changes

### Branch Information

**Note**: Due to environment constraints, changes were committed to `copilot/fix-popup-height-issue` branch. 
**Recommended action**: Create a new branch `fix/size-modal-to-tallest-tab` from the latest commit and open PR from there as specified in the requirements.

## Verification Checklist

## Future Enhancements

If further improvements are needed:
1. Add smooth transition animations when modal resizes
2. Remember last tab selection per zone (localStorage)
3. Add visual indicator for which tab is largest
4. Implement custom scrollbar styling for better UX
