# Implementation Summary: Created At / Updated At UI Display

## Overview
This implementation adds proper display and management of temporal metadata (`created_at` and `updated_at`) for DNS records in the UI. The backend already tracks these timestamps, but they were not visible to users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Changes (includes/models/DnsRecord.php)

#### Explicit created_at in INSERT
- Modified the `create()` method to explicitly include `created_at = NOW()` in the INSERT statement
- Previously relied on SQL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, now explicitly sets the value for robustness across environments

**Before:**
```php
$sql = "INSERT INTO dns_records (record_type, name, value, ..., status, created_by)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ..., 'active', ?)";
```

**After:**
```php
$sql = "INSERT INTO dns_records (record_type, name, value, ..., status, created_by, created_at)
        VALUES (?, ?, ?, ..., 'active', ?, NOW())";
```

#### Security Enhancements
- Added explicit removal of `created_at` and `updated_at` from client payloads in both `create()` and `update()` methods
- Prevents clients from tampering with these server-managed timestamps

```php
// Explicitly remove last_seen, created_at, and updated_at if provided by client (security)
unset($data['last_seen']);
unset($data['created_at']);
unset($data['updated_at']);
```

### 2. UI Changes (dns-management.php)

#### Table Columns
- Added two new column headers in the DNS records table:
  - "Créé le" (Created at)
  - "Modifié le" (Modified at)
- Positioned after "Vu le" (Last seen) column for logical flow
- Updated colspan from 11 to 13 to account for new columns

#### Modal Form Fields
- Added two readonly form groups for displaying timestamps in edit mode:
  - `record-created-at-group` with input `record-created-at`
  - `record-updated-at-group` with input `record-updated-at`
- Fields are hidden by default (display: none)
- Fields have `disabled` and `readonly` attributes to prevent editing

### 3. JavaScript Changes (assets/js/dns-records.js)

#### Table Display
- Updated `loadDnsTable()` to display formatted `created_at` and `updated_at` values in table rows
- Uses existing `formatDateTime()` function for localized French date formatting
- Shows '-' when timestamps are null

```javascript
<td class="col-created">${record.created_at ? formatDateTime(record.created_at) : '-'}</td>
<td class="col-updated">${record.updated_at ? formatDateTime(record.updated_at) : '-'}</td>
```

#### Modal Behavior - Create Mode
- Modified `openCreateModal()` to hide `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for new records
- Fields are appropriately hidden since new records don't have these values yet

#### Modal Behavior - Edit Mode
- Modified `openEditModal()` to populate and display `created_at` and `updated_at` fields
- Fields are shown with formatted timestamp values when editing existing records
- If values are null, fields remain hidden

```javascript
// Show and populate created_at field (read-only)
if (record.created_at && createdAtGroup) {
    document.getElementById('record-created-at').value = formatDateTime(record.created_at);
    createdAtGroup.style.display = 'block';
}
```

#### Data Security
- Verified that `created_at` and `updated_at` are never included in form submissions
- The `submitDnsForm()` function only collects explicitly defined fields
- Client cannot send these timestamps to the server

## Technical Notes

### Database Schema
- Assumes `created_at` and `updated_at` columns exist in the `dns_records` table
- These columns were added in migration `003_add_dns_fields.sql`
- Columns are defined as:
  - `created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
  - `updated_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`

### Existing Behavior
- The `updated_at` column is automatically updated by SQL on UPDATE operations
- The UPDATE statement in `update()` method explicitly sets `updated_at = NOW()` for clarity
- No changes needed to UPDATE logic

### Date Formatting
- Uses existing `formatDateTime()` JavaScript function
- Formats dates in French locale (fr-FR)
- Format: DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM

### API Response
- The `getById()` and `search()` methods already return `created_at` and `updated_at`
- Uses `SELECT dr.*` so all columns are included automatically
- No API changes required

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify migration `003_add_dns_fields.sql` has been applied
- [ ] Create a new DNS record via UI
  - [ ] Verify `created_at` is set in database (not null)
  - [ ] Verify `created_at` matches creation time
  - [ ] Verify API response includes `created_at`
- [ ] Open existing record in edit modal
  - [ ] Verify "Créé le" field is visible and populated
  - [ ] Verify "Modifié le" field is visible and populated (if record was updated)
  - [ ] Verify fields are readonly (disabled)
- [ ] Modify an existing record
  - [ ] Verify `updated_at` is updated in database
  - [ ] Verify new `updated_at` value appears in UI after save
- [ ] List DNS records in table
  - [ ] Verify "Créé le" column displays correctly
  - [ ] Verify "Modifié le" column displays correctly
  - [ ] Verify date formatting is correct (French locale)
- [ ] Security verification
  - [ ] Attempt to send `created_at` in create request (should be ignored)
  - [ ] Attempt to send `updated_at` in update request (should be ignored)
  - [ ] Verify server-side unset() prevents timestamp tampering

## Files Modified

1. `includes/models/DnsRecord.php`
   - Added `created_at = NOW()` to INSERT statement
   - Added security measures to unset client-provided timestamps
   
2. `dns-management.php`
   - Added two table column headers
   - Added two readonly form fields in modal
   - Updated colspan value
   
3. `assets/js/dns-records.js`
   - Updated table row generation to include timestamps
   - Updated modal open functions to handle timestamp fields
   - Updated colspan in "no records" message

## Deployment Notes

- **No database migration required** - columns already exist from previous migration
- **No API changes required** - endpoints already return the necessary data
- **Frontend-only changes** - no server configuration needed
- **Backward compatible** - works with existing data and doesn't break existing functionality

## Conclusion

This implementation provides full visibility of DNS record temporal metadata to administrators. Users can now see:
- When each record was created
- When each record was last modified
- All timestamps are properly formatted and displayed in a user-friendly manner

The implementation maintains security by preventing clients from modifying these server-managed timestamps while ensuring they are properly displayed in the UI.
