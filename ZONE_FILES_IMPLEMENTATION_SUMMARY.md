# Zone Files and Applications Management - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive zone file and application management to the DNS3 system, ensuring that every DNS record is associated with a zone file. The implementation follows the requirements specified in the problem statement.

## Database Changes

### New Tables

1. **zone_files**
   - Primary table for managing DNS zone files
   - Fields: id, name, filename, content, file_type (master/include), status, created_by, updated_by, created_at, updated_at
   - Supports both master zones and include files
   - Status: active, inactive, deleted

2. **zone_file_includes**
   - Junction table for master/include relationships
   - Links master zones to their include files
   - Fields: master_id, include_id, created_at

3. **applications**
   - Application management table
   - Each application is linked to exactly one zone file
   - Fields: id, name, description, owner, zone_file_id, status, created_at, updated_at

4. **zone_file_history**
   - Audit trail for zone file changes
   - Tracks all modifications including content changes
   - Fields: id, zone_file_id, action, name, filename, file_type, old_status, new_status, old_content, new_content, changed_by, changed_at, notes

### Modified Tables

1. **dns_records**
   - Added: zone_file_id INT NULL (nullable for migration)
   - Added index: idx_zone_file_id
   - Foreign key constraint available (commented) for optional enforcement

2. **dns_record_history**
   - Added: zone_file_id INT NULL
   - Ensures history tracking includes zone information

## Backend Models

### ZoneFile.php
- Full CRUD operations for zone files
- Methods:
  - `search()` - Filter and search zone files
  - `getById()` - Get zone by ID
  - `getByName()` - Get zone by name
  - `create()` - Create new zone file
  - `update()` - Update zone file
  - `setStatus()` - Change zone status
  - `assignInclude()` - Link include file to master zone
  - `getIncludes()` - Get all includes for a master zone
  - `writeHistory()` - Record zone changes
  - `getHistory()` - Retrieve zone change history

### Application.php
- Full CRUD operations for applications
- Methods:
  - `search()` - Filter and search applications
  - `getById()` - Get application by ID
  - `getByName()` - Get application by name
  - `create()` - Create new application (validates zone_file_id)
  - `update()` - Update application (validates zone_file_id if changed)
  - `setStatus()` - Change application status

### DnsRecord.php (Modified)
- Enhanced to require and manage zone_file_id
- Changes:
  - `create()`: Now requires zone_file_id, validates it references an active zone
  - `update()`: Allows zone_file_id changes, validates if provided
  - `search()`: LEFT JOINs zone_files to expose zone_name
  - `getById()`: LEFT JOINs zone_files to expose zone_name
  - `writeHistory()`: Includes zone_file_id in history records

## API Endpoints

### Zone API (api/zone_api.php)
- `list_zones` - List zone files with filters (name, file_type, status)
- `get_zone` - Get specific zone with includes and history
- `create_zone` - Create new zone file (admin only, validates file_type)
- `update_zone` - Update zone file (admin only)
- `set_status_zone` - Change zone status (admin only)
- `assign_include` - Link include to master zone (admin only)
- `download_zone` - Download zone file content

### Application API (api/app_api.php)
- `list_apps` - List applications with filters (name, status, zone_file_id)
- `get_app` - Get specific application
- `create_app` - Create new application (admin only, validates zone_file_id)
- `update_app` - Update application (admin only, validates zone_file_id if changed)
- `set_status_app` - Change application status (admin only)

### DNS API (api/dns_api.php) - Modified
- `create` action: Now requires zone_file_id, validates zone exists and is active
- `list` action: Returns zone_name for each record
- `get` action: Returns zone_name and zone_file_id
- `update` action: Allows zone_file_id changes, validates if provided

## UI Changes

### dns-management.php
1. **Table Layout**
   - Added "Zone" column as the FIRST column
   - Displays zone name for each DNS record
   - Updated colspan for empty table message (13 → 14)

2. **Create/Edit Modal**
   - Added "Fichier de zone" dropdown as the FIRST form field
   - Dropdown is populated dynamically via API
   - Shows only active zones with file_type 'master' or 'include'
   - Format: "zone_name (file_type)"
   - Required field for creating records
   - Allows changing zone when editing records

### dns-records.js
1. **New Functions**
   - `getZoneApiUrl()` - Construct URLs for zone API calls
   - `zoneApiCall()` - Make API calls to zone endpoints
   - `loadZoneFiles()` - Populate zone selector with active master/include zones

2. **Modified Functions**
   - `loadDnsTable()`: Updated to display zone column (first position)
   - `openCreateModal()`: Loads zone files before showing modal
   - `openEditModal()`: Loads zone files and sets current zone in selector
   - `submitDnsForm()`: Includes zone_file_id in create/update requests, validates selection

## Key Features

### Zone File Management
✅ Create master and include zone files
✅ Store zone file content
✅ Track zone file history (including content changes)
✅ Link include files to master zones
✅ Download zone file content
✅ Active/inactive/deleted status management

### Application Management
✅ Create applications linked to zone files
✅ Each application references exactly one zone file
✅ Validate zone_file_id on create and update
✅ Filter applications by zone
✅ Status management (active/inactive/deleted)

### DNS Record Integration
✅ Zone column displayed as first column in table
✅ Zone selector as first field in create/edit modal
✅ zone_file_id required for new DNS records
✅ zone_file_id can be changed when editing (migration-friendly)
✅ Zone selector lists only active master and include zones
✅ Validation ensures referenced zone exists and is active
✅ LEFT JOIN preserves existing records without zones

### Validation & Security
✅ Admin-only access for create/update/delete operations
✅ Zone existence and status validation
✅ Foreign key support (optional, commented in migration)
✅ Full history tracking for audit trails
✅ Proper error messages for missing or invalid zone_file_id

## Migration Strategy

The implementation is designed for backward compatibility:

1. **Nullable zone_file_id**: Existing records without zones continue to work
2. **API Validation**: New records MUST have a zone, enforced at API level
3. **Optional FK**: Foreign key constraint is commented out, can be enabled after cleanup
4. **Gradual Migration**: Records can be updated incrementally to add zones

## Testing

See `ZONE_FILES_TESTING_GUIDE.md` for comprehensive testing instructions including:
- Database migration verification
