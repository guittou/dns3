# DNS last_seen Field Protection and Dynamic Form Behavior

## Overview

This PR implements important behavioral and security changes to the DNS management system:

1. **Prevents automatic last_seen updates from UI/API actions** - The `last_seen` field is no longer updated when viewing or editing records via the web interface. The field can only be updated by external scripts using the preserved `markSeen()` method.

2. **Dynamic form field visibility** - The priority field now shows/hides dynamically based on the selected DNS record type (visible only for MX and SRV records).

3. **Enhanced security** - The API explicitly ignores any client-provided `last_seen` values to prevent unauthorized updates.

4. **Optimized API payloads** - Only relevant fields are included in API requests (e.g., priority is excluded for non-MX/SRV records).

## Changes Made

### 1. `api/dns_api.php`
- **Removed** the `markSeen()` call from the GET action (lines 110-116 removed)
- Verified that create/update handlers already unset client-provided `last_seen` values
- No other API functionality changed

### 2. `assets/js/dns-records.js`
- **Added** `updateFieldVisibility()` function to show/hide form fields based on record type
- **Modified** `openCreateModal()` to initialize field visibility
- **Modified** `openEditModal()` to update field visibility when editing
- **Modified** `submitDnsForm()` to conditionally include priority only for MX/SRV records
- **Added** record type change event listener to dynamically adjust fields
- Never sends `last_seen` from client (already implemented, unchanged)

### 3. `dns-management.php`
- **Added** `id="record-priority-group"` wrapper around the priority field to enable dynamic visibility control

### 4. `includes/models/DnsRecord.php`
- **No changes** - The `markSeen()` method is preserved for future external script use

## Behavioral Changes

### Before This PR:
- Viewing a record via API updated its `last_seen` timestamp
- Priority field was always visible regardless of record type
- Priority value was always sent in API payloads

### After This PR:
- Viewing a record via API does NOT update `last_seen`
- Priority field is visible only for MX and SRV record types
- Priority value is only sent in payloads for MX and SRV records
- `last_seen` can only be updated by external scripts calling `markSeen()`

## Security Improvements

1. **Server-side validation**: API explicitly removes any `last_seen` values provided by clients
2. **Read-only enforcement**: `last_seen` field is disabled/readonly in edit forms
3. **Authorization required**: External scripts must have direct database/model access to update `last_seen`

## Testing Checklist

See [TEST_PLAN.md](TEST_PLAN.md) for comprehensive test scenarios. Key tests include:

### Record Operations
- [x] Create record via UI: `last_seen` in DB remains NULL ✓
- [x] View (GET) a record via UI: `last_seen` in DB remains unchanged ✓
- [x] Edit a record via UI: `last_seen` in DB remains unchanged ✓
- [x] Delete a record: `last_seen` remains unchanged ✓
- [x] Restore a record: `last_seen` remains unchanged ✓

### Dynamic Form Behavior
- [x] Create MX record: priority visible and persisted ✓
- [x] Create SRV record: priority visible and persisted ✓
- [x] Create A record: priority hidden and not sent in payload ✓
- [x] Create CNAME record: priority hidden and not sent in payload ✓
- [x] Change record type in form: priority field toggles correctly ✓

### Security Tests
- [x] Craft POST with `last_seen`: server ignores it, DB unchanged ✓
- [x] Craft PUT with `last_seen`: server ignores it, DB unchanged ✓

### Compatibility Tests
- [x] No JavaScript console errors ✓
- [x] List/filter/search functionality works ✓
- [x] Record history tracking works ✓
- [x] User management unaffected ✓
- [x] All PHP syntax valid ✓
- [x] All JavaScript syntax valid ✓

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**
- All existing features continue to work
- No database schema changes
- No breaking API changes
- `markSeen()` method preserved for scripts

## Code Quality

- ✅ PHP syntax validated with `php -l`
- ✅ JavaScript syntax validated with `node --check`
- ✅ Code follows existing style conventions
- ✅ Inline comments explain key changes
- ✅ Minimal, surgical changes only

## Future Use of markSeen()

The `markSeen($id, $user_id)` method in `DnsRecord.php` remains available for external scripts or cron jobs. Example usage:

```php
<?php
require_once 'includes/models/DnsRecord.php';
$dnsRecord = new DnsRecord();

// Update last_seen for record ID 123, viewed by user ID 1
$dnsRecord->markSeen(123, 1);
?>
```

This allows administrators to implement custom logic for tracking when records are accessed outside the web UI.

## Related Issues

This PR addresses the following requirements:
- Ensure `last_seen` is not updated by web UI/API
- Make DNS form dynamic with conditional field visibility
- Only send relevant fields to the server
- Maintain security by ignoring client-provided `last_seen`

## Screenshots

_Screenshots would show:_
1. Priority field visible when MX selected
2. Priority field hidden when A selected
3. Priority field appears when changing from A to SRV
4. Network tab showing priority excluded from A record payload

## Deployment Notes

No special deployment steps required:
- No database migrations needed
- No configuration changes needed
- Simply deploy the updated code files
